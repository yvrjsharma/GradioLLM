        "- <b>Langchain & OpenAI Function Calling</b>: AI models like gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613, are designed to identify when and how to activate functions through API calls. These function-specific APIs generate a JSON object with necessary arguments, aiming to surpass the efficacy of traditional chat or text completion APIs.<br><br>\n",
        "- <b>Gradio Chatbots</b>: Gradio provides super easy way to build Chatbot UI. Refer our <a href=\"https://gradio.app/docs/#chatbot\" target=\"_blank\">Docs</a>. Using Langchain's OpenAI Functions Agent you can create chatbots designed to respond to queries by communicating with external APIs. The API responses are fed back to the Language Model for processing and a new response is generated for the user.The versatility of using Gradio to build LLM applications is immense. FOr example, in this Gradio app, you can have an array of Plugins based on functions which are tailored for various purposes (image, video, audio, text generation, utilities etc). This enhancing the breadth and depth of interactions with your Language Model.\n"

The API responses are fed back to the Language Model for processing and a new response is generated for the user.The versatility of using Gradio to build LLM applications is immense.
